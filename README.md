# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN
It is a simple application of Convolutional Neural Networks

In deep learning, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is at
the center of spectacular advances that mixes Artificial Neural
Network (ANN) and up to date deep learning strategies. It has
been used broadly in pattern recognition, sentence
classification, speech recognition, face recognition, text
categorization, document analysis, scene, and handwritten digit
recognition. The goal of this project is to observe the variation of
accuracies of CNN to classify handwritten digits using various
numbers of hidden layers and epochs and to make the
comparison between the accuracies. For this performance
evaluation of CNN, we will useModified National Institute of Standards and Technology
(MNIST) dataset. Further, the network is trained using
stochastic gradient descent and the back-propagation
algorithm.
